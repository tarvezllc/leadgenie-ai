# 🏠 Property Matching Test

## What Should Happen Now:

When a lead is created, the chatbot should:

1. ✅ **Create the lead** in the database
2. ✅ **Call the property matching AI** to find relevant properties
3. ✅ **Show property suggestions** in the success message
4. ✅ **Update the dashboard** with the new lead

## Test Conversation:

Try this conversation in the chatbot:

```
User: "Hi, I'm looking for a house"
Bot: "Great! What's your budget range?"
User: "My name is John"
Bot: "Nice to meet you John! What area are you thinking?"
User: "Around 50k"
Bot: "Perfect! What type of property are you looking for?"
User: "San Francisco"
Bot: "Excellent! When are you looking to move?"
User: "house"
Bot: "Great! What's your phone number?"
User: "immediate"
Bot: "Perfect! What's your phone number?"
User: "555-123-4567"
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Lead created in dashboard
- ✅ Success message shows property suggestions like:
  - "I found 2 properties that match your criteria:
    1. **Modern Downtown Condo** - $850,000
       San Francisco, CA • 2 bed, 2 bath
    2. **Family Home with Garden** - $1,200,000
       San Francisco, CA • 4 bed, 3 bath
    One of our real estate agents will contact you within 24 hours to schedule viewings! 🏠✨"
