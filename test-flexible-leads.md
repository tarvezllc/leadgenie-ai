# 🧪 Test Flexible Lead Creation

## New Flexible Qualification Logic

The chatbot now creates leads much more easily, like real platforms:

### ✅ **Will Create Leads For:**

1. **Minimal Interest + Contact**
   ```
   User: "Hi, I'm looking for a house"
   Bot: "Great! What's your budget range?"
   User: "My name is John"
   Bot: "Nice to meet you John! What area are you thinking?"
   User: "Around 50k"
   → ✅ LEAD CREATED (has interest + name + budget)
   ```

2. **Casual Conversation**
   ```
   User: "Hey, I need an apartment"
   Bot: "I'd love to help! What's your budget?"
   User: "My phone is 555-123-4567"
   Bot: "Perfect! What area are you looking in?"
   User: "Downtown"
   → ✅ LEAD CREATED (has interest + phone + location)
   ```

3. **Email Instead of Phone**
   ```
   User: "I want to buy a house"
   Bot: "That's exciting! What's your budget range?"
   User: "john@email.com"
   Bot: "Thanks! What area are you thinking?"
   User: "Near the city center"
   → ✅ LEAD CREATED (has interest + email + location)
   ```

### ❌ **Won't Create Leads For:**

1. **No Real Estate Interest**
   ```
   User: "Hi, how are you?"
   Bot: "I'm great! How can I help with real estate?"
   User: "I'm John"
   → ❌ NO LEAD (no real estate interest)
   ```

2. **Too Few Messages**
   ```
   User: "I want a house"
   → ❌ NO LEAD (only 1 message, need at least 3)
   ```

## Key Improvements:

- ✅ **Much more flexible** - creates leads with minimal info
- ✅ **Accepts email OR phone** - not both required
- ✅ **Detects real estate interest** - house, apartment, buy, rent, etc.
- ✅ **Better name extraction** - handles "I'm John", "Call me Sarah", etc.
- ✅ **Like real platforms** - creates leads when users show interest

## Test These Conversations:

1. "Hi, I'm looking for a house" → "My name is John" → "Around 50k"
2. "I need an apartment" → "555-123-4567" → "Downtown area"
3. "Want to buy a home" → "john@email.com" → "Near schools"
